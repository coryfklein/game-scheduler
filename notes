Life is better with games than without. I've brought my Dominion set to work, and anybody who wants to play, or learn how to play, during lunch is most welcome.

Dominion is a 2-4 player game. The game cards are randomized each game so every round is unique. This means you need to think of a creative new strategy each time if you expect to win. If you have never played, it is pretty easy to pick up, and I think you'll find it very enjoyable.

Games run between 10-30 minutes, and I think we could manage 2-3 rounds during a lunch break if we eat fast.

I set up this Domo card to organize the game. Sign ups to play tomorrow are open immediately. The card will also let you back out if you decide you don't want to play. Sign ups are limited to 4 players each day, so if you want in on the action then sign up quick.

If we tire of Dominion, I'm happy to consider alternatives such as Carcassonne, Lost Cities, Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, etc.
